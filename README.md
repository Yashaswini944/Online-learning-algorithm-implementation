# Online-learning-algorithm-implementation
An online learning model updates itself continuously as new data becomes available, making it well‑suited for streaming and real‑time applications. In this project, we build an incremental logistic regression classifier using scikit‑learn’s SGDClassifier, which supports mini‑batch updates and enables the model to learn on the fly.
